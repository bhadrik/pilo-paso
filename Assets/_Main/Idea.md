1. Make hardness level like how hard you want to play
    -> dice need to match pattern exactly with tiles
    -> Introduce complete in time for more reward
    -> Complete in steps to more reward
    -> steping on tile rolll the dice totaly random
    -> One time walkable tile
    -> Game end on last tile cube animation
    -> Complete it on last move win extra reward
    -> Connected tiles one will activate other
    -> New type of tile: It teleport cube somewere else

    level 3 27 step remain and completed

    if game complete at last move it will do both because both move end and game complete happen.
